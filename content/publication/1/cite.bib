abstract  ="Employing the concept of effective Hamiltonians{,} an analytical theory is introduced to describe transitions in a multi-level system in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Specifically{,} the discussion is centered towards the treatment of selective and non-selective excitations in static quadrupolar spin (I > 1/2) systems. To this end{,} effective radiofrequency (RF) Hamiltonians based on the spherical tensor formalism are proposed for describing transitions in both integral (I = 1{,} 2 and 3) and half-integral (I = 3/2{,} 5/2 and 7/2) quadrupolar spins. The optimum conditions desired for selective excitation in a multi-level system are derived pedagogically from first principles and presented through analytical expressions. Employing suitable model systems{,} the derived optimum conditions are substantiated through rigorous numerical simulations based on the spherical tensor formalism. The theory presented provides a framework for describing selective and non-selective RF pulses and could improve our understanding of multiple-pulse experiments involving quadrupolar nuclei."}
