abstract: In this article, a simple heuristic approach that is in agreement with the density operator formalism is presented for understanding the mechanism of multi-quantum (MQ) excitation in half-integral quadrupolar systems. Employing the population level diagram of the nuclear spin states, the effect of radio-frequency (RF) pulses on multi-level systems is described. Based on this approach, alternate schemes that involve non-equilibrium spin states are proposed for improving the sensitivity of MQ experiments in spin 3/2 and 5/2 systems. Additionally, the utility of frequency sweep techniques in the excitation of MQ transitions is discussed. The results obtained from the analytic theory are substantiated through numerical simulations.
