abstract  ="With the development of technology and improved understanding of nuclear spin–spin interactions and their behavior in static/oscillating magnetic fields{,} NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing molecular structure in a wide range of systems of chemical{,} physical and biological relevance. Here in this article{,} we revisit the important connection between “Secular-Approximation” (a well-known fundamental concept) and NMR spectroscopy. Employing recent experimental results as the background{,} an alternate interpretation of the secular approximation is presented for describing and understanding the nuances of Multi-Quantum (MQ) NMR spectroscopy of quadrupolar nuclei. Since MQ NMR spectroscopy of quadrupolar nuclei forms the basis of the structural characterization of inorganic solids and clusters{,} we believe that the analytic theory presented herein would be beneficial both in the understanding and design of MQ NMR experiments. Additionally{,} the analytic results are corroborated with rigorous numerical simulations and could be employed in the quantitative interpretation of experimental results."}
