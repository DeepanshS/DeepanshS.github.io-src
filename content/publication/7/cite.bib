    abstract = {The Core Scientific Dataset (CSD) model with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) serialization is presented as a lightweight, portable, and versatile standard for intra- and interdisciplinary scientific data exchange. This model supports datasets with a p-component dependent variable, {U0, …, Uq, …, Up−1}, discretely sampled at M unique points in a d-dimensional independent variable (X0, …, Xk, …, Xd−1) space. Moreover, this sampling is over an orthogonal grid, regular or rectilinear, where the principal coordinate axes of the grid are the independent variables. It can also hold correlated datasets assuming the different physical quantities (dependent variables) are sampled on the same orthogonal grid of independent variables. The model encapsulates the dependent variables’ sampled data values and the minimum metadata needed to accurately represent this data in an appropriate coordinate system of independent variables. The CSD model can serve as a re-usable building block in the development of more sophisticated portable scientific dataset file standards.},
