I work on developing solid-state magnetic resonance methods for characterizing
amorphous and crystalline materials. I also develop numerical libraries in C and
python for simulating magnetic resonance spectrum of amorphous and crystalline materials.
I am also involved in developing library tools for processing and analyzing the
solid-state magnetic resonance spectrum of disordered and amorphous materials
using linear-inversion and machine learning approaches.
