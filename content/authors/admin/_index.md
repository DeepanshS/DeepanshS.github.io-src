I work on developing/improving solid-state magnetic resonance methods for better
characterization of amorphous and crystalline materials. I also develop numerical
libraries in C and python for simulating, processing, and analyzing the multi-dimensional
magnetic resonance spectrum of amorphous and crystalline materials using statistical
learning, linear-inversions, and machine learning approaches.
