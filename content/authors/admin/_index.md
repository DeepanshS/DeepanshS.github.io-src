Result-driven research scientist specializes in developing new and improving existing methods in solid-state magnetic resonance for better understanding and characterizing of materials, both amorphous and crystalline, and bio-macromolecules. Recent work focuses on structural elucidation of materials from the 2D NMR spectrum. I am also a passionate developer of high throughput numerical libraries and software for simulating, processing, and analyzing scientific data using a multitude of tools, including statistical learning, linear-inversions, and machine learning. Proficient in C, python, and javascript programming languages, open to others as needed.
